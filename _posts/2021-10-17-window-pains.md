This is a writeup on 4 forensics challenges at DEADFACE CTF 2021. I really enjoyed these challenges because they introduced me to Volatility, an essential memory analysis tool for anyone looking to go into digital forensics. 

# Window Pains

> One of De Monne's employees had their personal Windows computer hacked by a member of DEADFACE. The attacker managed to exploit a portion of a database backup that contains sensitive employee and customer PII.  Inspect the memory dump and tell us the Windows Major Operating System Version, bit version, and the image date/time (UTC, no spaces or special characters). Submit the flag as flag{OS_BIT_YYYYMMDDhhmmss}.
