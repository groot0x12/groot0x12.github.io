This is a writeup of one of my favourite Web challenges from NUS Greyhats CTF 2021. This challenge was entitled "Covid Tracker" and was an Intermediate level challenge, and serves as a great recap for error-based SQL Injection.

# Landing 

The challenge first starts out with a link that brings us to a landing page containing a login portal. We immediately try a standard SQL injection payload for authentication bypass as seen from the payload below.

This payload works because the user's POST input is being directly used in a SQL query that is likely of the following form.

``` sql
SELECT user FROM users WHERE username = '<POST DATA>' AND password = '<POST DATA>';
```

Sending the payload `' or 1=1; --` then results in the query being:
```sql
SELECT user FROM users WHERE username = '' or 1=1; --' AND password = '<POST DATA>';
```

This selects all users in the database and comments away the code for a password check, allowing us to bypass authentication. It seems like there is only 1 entry in the database as `LIMIT 1` is not needed in our exploit payload.

# Through The Gates
Past the login screen, we are presented with a COVID tracker showing the various number of cases at various locations across Singapore. There is also a search bar that allows us to filter these locations. Could it be, another SQL Injection?
