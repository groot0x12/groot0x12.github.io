This is a writeup of one of my favourite Web challenges from NUS Greyhats CTF 2021. This challenge was entitled "Covid Tracker" and was an Intermediate level challenge, and serves as a great recap for error-based SQL Injection.

# Landing 

The challenge first starts out with a link that brings us to a landing page containing a login portal. We immediately try a standard SQL injection payload for authentication bypass as seen from the payload below.

This payload works because the user's POST input is being directly used in a SQL query that is likely of the following form.

``` sql
SELECT user FROM users WHERE username = '<POST DATA>' AND password = '<POST DATA>';
```

Sending the payload `' or 1=1; --` then results in the query being:
```sql
SELECT user FROM users WHERE username = '' or 1=1; --' AND password = '<POST DATA>';
```

This selects all users in the database and comments away the code for a password check, allowing us to bypass authentication. It seems like there is only 1 entry in the database as `LIMIT 1` is not needed in our exploit payload.

# Through The Gates
Past the login screen, we are presented with a COVID tracker showing the various number of cases at various locations across Singapore. There is also a search bar that allows us to filter these locations. Could it be, another SQL Injection?

We immediately try the same payload in hopes that the POST data will be likewise used in an SQL query.

We note that all the waypoints are still present. Seems like it is indeed vulnerable to SQL injection. If it was blacklisted in any way, then it would not return all the waypoints correctly. This gives us a rough idea of what the query could be like.

```sql
SELECT locations, caseNums FROM covidTable WHERE locations = '<POST_DATA>'
```

With this in mind, my first thought process was to attempt to use `ORDER BY` to enumerate the number of columns. `ORDER BY` is a SQL clause that sorts a data set according to a particular column, which is specified via either the column name or an integer specifying the column order. By leveraging the latter, we can use errors to tell us which is the correct number of columns. This approach is known as error-based SQL injection!
