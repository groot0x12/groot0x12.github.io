This is a writeup of one of my favourite Web challenges from NUS Greyhats CTF 2021. This challenge was entitled "Covid Tracker" and was an Intermediate level challenge, and serves as a great recap for error-based SQL Injection.

# Landing 

The challenge first starts out with a link that brings us to a landing page containing a login portal. We immediately try a standard SQL injection payload for authentication bypass as seen from the payload below.

This payload works because the user's POST input is being directly used in a SQL query that is likely of the following form.

``` sql
SELECT user FROM users WHERE username = '<POST DATA>' AND password = '<POST DATA>';
```

Sending the payload `' or 1=1; --` then results in the query being:
```sql
SELECT user FROM users WHERE username = '' or 1=1; --' AND password = '<POST DATA>';
```
